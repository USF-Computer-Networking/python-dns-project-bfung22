The command dig is a tool for querying DNS nameservers for information about host addresses, mail exchanges, nameservers, and related information. This tool can be used from any Linux (Unix) or Macintosh OS X operating system. The most typical use of dig is to simply query a single host.

dig will let you perform any valid DNS query, the most common of which are:

A (the IP address),
CNAME (Alias record),
MX (mail exchanges), and
NS nameservers.
